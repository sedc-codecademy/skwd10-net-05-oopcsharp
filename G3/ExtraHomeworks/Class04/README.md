# Homework Class 4 ðŸ“’

## Task 1:
Create a function to say whether a string is symmetric (a palindrome). For example, "RADAR" is a palindrome.

## Task 2:
Create a function which returns the greatest value stored in an array of real numbers which is specified as parameter.

## Task 3:
Create a two function that calculates the amount of numeric digits and vowels(samoglaski) that a text string contains.
It will accept one parameter parameter: the string that we want to search,
 * Function 1 should return the number of digits, 
 * Function 2 should return the number of vowels. 
# Do not name them function1 and 2 :)

## Task 4:
Create a function to read a sentence from input and replace lowercase characters by uppercase and vice-versa.

## Task 5:
Create a function to check whether a character is an alphabet or not and if so go to check for the case.

## Task 6:
Create a function to find the number of times a substring appears in a given string.

## Task 7:
Create a function that calculates the result of raising an integer to another integer (eg 5 raised to 3 = 53 = 5 × 5 × 5 = 125). 


# Good luck and happy coding
